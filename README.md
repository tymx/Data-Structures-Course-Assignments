# Data-Structures-Course-Assignments
Assignments I completed in the Spring of 2019 for Data Structures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Assignments consisted of creating a Double Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Minimum Binary Heap, Splay Tree, and a Directed Graph with nodes and edges. Also in the Directed Graph made a function to find the shortest path from starting node to all nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. Instructor gave us starter files and students were tasked to add functionality and create new classes if necessary.
