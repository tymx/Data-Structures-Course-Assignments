# Data-Structures-Course-Assignments
Assignments I completed in the Spring of 2019 for Data Structures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Assignments consisted of creating a Double Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Minimum Binary Heap, Splay Tree, and a Directed Graph with nodes and edges. Also in the Directed Graph made a function to find the shortest path from starting node to all nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
